Campus Connect was built upon a social blog post app created by Miguel Grinberg. We also utilized an HTML-5 template for our landing page. We have changed the code thoroughly, but are including these licenses below:

A clean, super minimal responsive template geared towards startups, app devs, and other
dedicated folks working tirelessly to launch their products. Includes a landing page,
generic page, contact page, and a page with a whole mess of pre-styled elements (something
new I'm trying out). Sass sources are also included.

Feedback, bug reports, and comments are not only welcome, but strongly encouraged :)

PS: Not sure how to get that contact form working? Give formspree.io a try (it's awesome).
